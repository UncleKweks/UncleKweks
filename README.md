# Kwesi 👨🏾‍💻

Hi, I’m **Kwesi**, a Blockchain developer, an independent blockchain security researcher, and a smart contract auditor. I specialize in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities across DeFi, NFT, and protocol-level systems, helping projects launch confidently and resiliently.

I actively compete in audit contests on top platforms like **Code4rena**, **Sherlock**, **CodeHawks**, **Cantina**, and **Immunefi**,  where I’ve contributed to securing millions in user funds. My work is driven by curiosity, precision, and a deep respect for decentralized ecosystems.

🔍 Whether it's gas optimization, logic flaws, or economic exploits, I’m all about finding what others miss. My goal? To make your smart contracts bulletproof.
